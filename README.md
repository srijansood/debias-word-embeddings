# debias-word-embeddings
Tackling Gender and Race bias in Word Embeddings. To run our code you will need Jupyter Notebook.

For running the scripts to generate the word embeddings you will need to install the gensim library and copy the full word2vec library in the same directory as the script.
To install gensim type 
`pip3 install gensim`

If you simply just wish to view the notebook just type
`jupyter notebook` 
in the repository.
